# Profile page

This is the document where I‚Äôll explain the way I‚Äôll start to develop my profile page.

Some of my motivations start with my own curiosity of use new technologies and also taking that as an advantage to start writing valuable software that can demonstrate my skills in writing maintainable and scalable code but also to learn new ways to structure projects so I can explore some of the features that can be provided by a full stack engineer. All of the code is going to be allocated on Github to it can be shown and reviewed by other people so they can also get an idea or provide me some feedback, so feel free to give it a look.

## Features

These are the features that I think can be showcased on a page such as this one are going to be implemented in other to show and document how I coded them, also they can be reviewed and bring feedback from other people I maybe, who knows, for my future self.

- **Internationalization**: I‚Äôm Mexican üá≤üáΩ, so my mother tongue is Spanish, and I believe this can be an advantage for different soft and hard skill development like storytelling, redaction, language domain, file structuring, translation, library and feature implementations, etc. And in a globally managed world, internationalization is been more and more needed for companies, so this can be a real advantage in providing a service or maybe just showing more technical skills.
- **Static Site Generation**: I‚Äôm convinced as an engineer that technology should serve specific needs in each case, and every case should be analyzed individually. In this case, a profile/blog page does not need to make use of a complex system design. Also, this can bring optimization by itself so the page can be served quickly and made accessible by saving energy and costs since it‚Äôs just serving static files.
- **Markdown fashion content**: Managing content can be a complex topic, and it can escalate quickly depending on the use case, but also, currently there are multiple ways to store and write rich text articles. Markdown is a format that has been widely adopted by a lot of services since it is easy to use and even to be extended, and in the software world, it‚Äôs been really adopted by companies such as Github, Notion, Slack, Obsidian, Discord, and many more. I consider that Notion is a good tool to write articles such as these ones and that‚Äôs another reason I‚Äôll be using this language.
- **Components Library**: Currently the concept of components is widely spread in the web and UI software development, I‚Äôve worked with different technologies during my career path: Angular, React, React Native, and Native Android and iOS development. And learned that components allow structuring the user interfaces in a way that can split each element of the interface in order to worry about only their specific concern (I might be talking more about this in future articles). But currently, I will be using React and NextJS for the purpose of building this page.

## More to come, and be defined‚Ä¶ üèóÔ∏è

There are more features that might be implemented in the future, but structuring an MVP is important to reach achievable results. And as an 8-year engineer, I know the importance of getting clear short and mid-term features for a project or product. I‚Äôll just leave some of the ideas that could be implemented on this page to make it more interesting and keep me busy üòÇ.

- API calls
- Embedding services
- Search Engine implementation
- Fun animations
